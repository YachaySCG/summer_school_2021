        "In the counterpart, RL methods still require too many samples to learn how to solve a given task. Some transfer-learning and human-interaction approaches [7-8] are current forms to reduce the experiences required in highly complex tasks. Another challenging gap is the real-world domain shifting, where the algorithm is more exposed to noise signals and other differences from a simulated environment."
